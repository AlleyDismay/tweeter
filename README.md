# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simplified Twitter profile page replica.

Using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX for the front-end, and their Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, posting and post display functionality has been replicated, along with display customization for a mobile user, but posts do not persist. They're only saved until the server is shut down.
